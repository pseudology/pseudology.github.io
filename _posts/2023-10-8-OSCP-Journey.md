Hello community,

I'm thrilled to share that I've achieved a perfect score of **100**, along with an additional **10 bonus points** on my **OSCP** (*Offensive Security Certified Professional*) exam. It feels absolutely surreal and incredibly exciting. Before I delve into my journey, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to the entire community for their unwavering support.

## **The Beginning of My Journey**

My journey began about **1.5 years ago** when I was in my second year of college, pursuing a **B.Tech in Computer Science** with a focus on cybersecurity. My fascination with cybersecurity and penetration testing had always been there, but it felt like an elusive dream due to information overload. Then, I stumbled upon a YouTuber's video detailing how he cracked the OSCP at the age of 20, and that was the turning point. I set a goal to obtain the certification before my final year of college.

## **The Learning Process**

I started my journey on **TryHackMe (THM)** when I won a one-month free access through a giveaway. It provided me with a foundation in basic cybersecurity concepts. However, my subscription eventually ended, and I moved on to the **Hack The Box (HTB) Academy**, where I embarked on the path of a penetration tester. I progressed through various modules, facing challenges along the way. When OffSec announced their Black Friday sale, I decided to invest in the OSCP certification, thanks to the support of my family.

## **The Grind Begins**

The real grind began when I started working on the **PWK (Penetration Testing with Kali Linux)** course materials. The learning curve was steep, and I encountered numerous difficulties initially. However, with determination and the help of friends I made along the way, I gradually made progress. In mid-April, OffSec introduced the **2023 version** of the course, which meant I had to start from scratch. Surprisingly, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as the new course was significantly improved with better labs and more comprehensive content.

## **Tackling the Labs**

During my summer break in **2023**, I set the goal of completing the course, and I managed to achieve it. By **July**, I was ready to tackle the labs. The labs were daunting, with endless pivoting and post-exploitation activities. I experienced moments of breakdown and took short breaks to recharge. However, each completed lab taught me valuable lessons, making subsequent ones easier. I successfully tackled **37 labs**, earning the **10 bonus points**.

## **Proving Grounds Challenge**

Next, I moved on to **Proving Grounds** and aimed to complete **TJNull's list** of vulnerable machines. Proving Grounds presented its own set of challenges, and I often needed hints to progress. Nevertheless, I understood that the journey was about learning, not perfection. I completed most of the Proving Grounds list and decided it was time to schedule my exam.

## **Preparing for the Exam**

In the days leading up to the exam, I reviewed my notes and sought additional resources online. I watched numerous videos, particularly focusing on **Active Directory (AD)** exploitation.

## **The Exam Day**

Finally, the exam day arrived. I began at **6:15 AM**, starting with the **AD set**. It took me an hour to gain a foothold, but I became stuck for an extended period around **12:30 PM**. I felt disheartened and believed I might not make it. However, after a short break, something clicked, and I managed to complete the AD section, earning **40 points** by **1:30 PM**. After a satisfying lunch, I resumed my efforts, feeling reenergized. Within an hour, I had another foothold and spent the next two hours on privilege escalation. I knew I had enough points to pass, but I decided to aim for a perfect score. Despite getting stuck on one box for two hours, I persevered. In the end, I conquered all the challenges by **8:30 PM**, earning the coveted **100 points**.

## **Overwhelming Joy**

I was overwhelmed with joy. A dream that seemed distant **1.5 years ago** was now a reality.I immediately began working on my report, finishing it by **3:30 AM**. I informed the proctor of my intention to end the exam and finally allowed myself a well-deserved rest. The next morning, I reviewed my report and submitted it. When I woke up, I couldn't believe my eyes—my portal displayed "**Congratulations**." I shared the news with my family and close friends and sat in disbelief.

## **Tips for Fellow Aspirants**

Here are some tips I'd like to offer to fellow aspirants:

1. **Persistence** is key—don't give up. Revert, enumerate, and keep trying.
2. Avoid **overthinking**; sometimes simplicity is the solution.
3. Don't feel discouraged if you need hints in the Proving Grounds; the journey is about learning.
4. Focus on the **course and labs**; additional resources can overwhelm you.
5. If you're pursuing the OSCP, **prioritize** it over other certifications to save time.
6. Consider your **eating habits**; avoid heavy meals during intense sessions.
7. **Thorough enumeration** is crucial; don't skip any steps.
8. Don't hesitate to use all your **reverts**—they're there to help you.

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I wanted to share my journey authentically. Once again, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone, and I wish you all the best in your endeavors!
